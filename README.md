Development
-----------

<details>

<summary>Requirements</summary>

- [Docker]
- [Docker Compose]
- [GNU Make]
- [Node.js]
- [Git LFS]
- [logcli]

</details>

The project contains a [Makefile] which uses [Docker] and [Docker Compose] for development.

### Running the app

To build and run the app for development, execute:

```shell
make dev
```

You can now access the app at <http://localhost:8080>.

<details>

<summary>Rebuilding the container</summary>

Static content is attached to the containers as volumes so most updates are visible without a need to rebuild the
container. However, changes to NPM dependencies, for example, require a rebuild. So you may need to execute

```shell
make dev
```

again before running further commands.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Configuring environment variables</summary>

You can use a `.env` file to pass environment variables to the container.

After running `make dev` the file will contain a set of instructions to follow.

Re-run `make dev` after modifying this file.

</details>

### Running the tests

We use [Jest] to test the app. You can run it by executing: 

```shell
make test
```

To run all the regression tests, execute:

```shell
make taiko
```

To run just one regression test file, execute:

```shell
make taiko TEST=[file-name].ts
```

### Linting

We lint the app with [ESLint]. You can run it by:

```shell
make lint
```

You can fix problems, where possible, by executing:

```shell
make lint:fix
```

## Operations

The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster via an Helm chart.

A [staging environment] is updated with every new commit on `main` that passes tests.

A [production environment] is [updated][production deployments] manually by pushing a tag.

### Releasing to production

Ensure your current reference is [green in CI][build].

Run `make release`.

### Looking at logs

Logs of all Pods are streamed to [AWS CloudWatch][AWS CloudWatch logs] for persistence and searchability.

A [CloudWatch dashboard] graphs log lines representing errors and shows the state of the alarm.

An [monitoring SNS topic] triggers a [lambda function that notifies the Slack #sciety-general channel][monitoring
 lambda].

A [CloudWatch user journey by IP] query is available to track a single client across multiple requests (adjust timeframe and IP).

### Updating event data

Run `make -j 4 update-event-data`.

Substitute `4` with the desired concurrency level.


### Dump all data

Run `make prod-sql`.

At the prompt, execute this command:

```sql
\copy (SELECT date, type, payload FROM events ORDER BY date) TO STDOUT WITH CSV;
```

### Update Data Studio

The export might take a few minutes.

Requires AWS access to the 540790251273 account. Ensure the AWS credentials point to the Sciety profile, e.g. by setting `AWS_PROFILE` (if needed).

```bash
make update-datastudio
```
