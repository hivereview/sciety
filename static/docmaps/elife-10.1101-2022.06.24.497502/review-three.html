<p>This manuscript aims to address whether age-related iron status influences differential effects of estrogen replacement on atherogenesis in postmenopausal females. Specifically, whether age-related iron accumulation reduces estrogen signaling through ERa receptor in relevant cell types (endothelial cells and macrophages). They test this fairly rigorously using in vitro, preclinical and clinical data, and the data is presented logically.</p>
<p>First, the authors demonstrate that in postmenopausal women, there is an inverse correlation between age-related increase in iron levels and age-related decrease in ERa levels in atherosclerotic plaques. This is consistent with the fact that, in ovariectomized (OVX) pro-atherogenic (ApoE KO) mice, there is differential effect of estrogen (E2) on ERa, atherosclerosis, lipid profiles and key biomarkers (ABCA1, eNOS, etc) based on age (early: 16 weeks, versus late: 40 weeks), with young mice responding favorably while older mice responding negatively. Consistent with this, in the older OVX ApoE KO mice, E2 treatment worsened atherosclerosis. Importantly, they point this differential effect of E2 to iron overload in macrophages using ApoE KO; LysM-macrophage-specific Fpn1 KO as E2 now has deleterious effects regardless of age. Next, using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to supplement iron and deferiprone (DFP) to chelate iron, they show that iron manipulation impacts the E2 response appropriately in the relevant cell types (endothelial cells and macrophage cells). Then they provide evidence for the MdM2-mediated post-translational regulation of ERa as a mechanism by which iron status impacts differential E2 has differential effects on ERa. Finally, they test the impact of systemic iron chelation on the OVX ApoE KO mice model of atherosclerosis and show that iron chelation attenuates the deleterious effects of E2 in late postmenopausal mice.</p>
<p>Overall the evidence is solid and logically laid out. Given that serum iron levels do not correlate with the rest of the story, inclusion of LysM-macrophage-specific Fpn1 KO provides the key evidence that iron loading in macrophages drives differential effects to E2 in postmenopausal mice. The paper provides evidence that iron levels influence how the relevant cells respond to E2 with clinical implications to hormonal replacement therapy in younger and older postmenopausal women. While this study is limited by a small clinical sample size, it provides an important framework for future studies on the impact of age-related iron status on the response to hormonal replacement therapy.</p>
