<p><strong>Evaluation Summary:</strong></p>
<p>It is believed that the reason why women generally have lower rates of atherosclerotic events than men until menopause is due to the beneficial effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular system. In this important study the authors attempt to explain why hormone replacement therapy with estrogen is not effective in preventing atherosclerosis in post-menopausal women by showing that iron accumulation prevents the hormone replacement therapy benefit through negative regulation of estrogen receptor expression via Mdm2-mediated proteolysis. The strength of evidence is incomplete with important control groups missing and a lack of clear-cut evidence this effect is related to the estradiol therapy in addition to the accumulation of iron in the post-menopausal state. The general public as well as specialists might find this work to be of interest.</p>
