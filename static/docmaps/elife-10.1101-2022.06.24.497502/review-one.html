    This paper provides experimental and modeling analysis of the inter-brain coupling of socially interacting bats, and reports that coordinated brain activity evolves at a slower time scale than the activity describing the differences. Specifically, the paper finds that there is an attracting submanifold corresponding to the mean (or "common mode") of neural activity, and that the dynamics in the orthogonal eigenmode, corresponding to the difference in brain activity, decays rapidly. These rapid decays in the difference mode are referred to as "catch up" activity.

    There are two main findings:

<li><p>
    Neural activity (especially higher frequency LFP activity in the 30-150Hz range) is modulated by social context. Specifically, the ratio of the averaged, moment-to-moment MEAN:DIFF ratio is much higher when the bats are in a single chamber, clearly indicating that the animals are coordinating their neural activity. This change also seems to hold -- although not as striking -- in lower-frequency LFP and spiking activity.

    The time scales of the mean vs. difference dynamics are segregated: the "difference dynamics" evolve at a faster time scale than "similarity dynamics", seems to be well supported.

    The basic finding is presented in Figure 1. The rest of the paper is focused on a modeling study to garner further insight into the dynamics.

<p>
    This is an entirely phenomenological paper, and while it claims to garner "mechanistic insight", it is unclear what that means.

    The basic idea of the model is simple and somewhat interesting, but the details are extremely complex. There are many examples of this, but the method used to "regress out" the behavior was very hard to interpret.

    On the face of it, the model is extremely simple: a two-state linear dynamical system. However, this simplistic description buries extreme complexity. The model is extremely complex as involves a large number of parameters (e.g., time switching 'b' values, the values of which are completely unclear), the switching over time of these parameters based on hand-scored animal behavioral state, and the complex mix of markovian and linear dynamical systems theoretic results. Indeed, a fundamental weakness of the model is that the Markov chain is taken as an "input" to the 2-state linear systems model, as if somehow the neural state does not affect the state transitions. Further, the Markov assumption is not rigorously tested. No model selecting or other model validation appears to be done.

<p>
    In short, the model, while very interesting, is so complex that it is literally impossible to evaluate. The authors report literally no shortcomings of their model. They do not report parameter estimation methods. They do not report fitting errors or other model validation metrics. The only evaluation is whether it can produce certain outputs that are similar to biological data. While the latter is certainly important, all models are wrong, and it essential to have a model simple enough to understand, both in terms of how it works and how it fails.
</p>
<p>
    In general, while the basic finding is fairly interesting, and the experiments and their findings are highly relevant to the field, the modeling and its explication fall short.
</p>
<p>
    It is not that it is wrong or bad; however, it is not clear that such a complex model increases our understanding beyond the experimental findings in Figure 1, and if it does, there has to be a major caveat that the model itself is not carefully vetted.
