<p>In this study, the authors seek to determine the potential role of aging-induced iron accumulation on the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on atherosclerosis in late postmenopausal women. The authors are commended for the novel and relevant line of investigation and the many complex experiments that they performed. Central to the manuscript, the authors find that high iron levels, in late postmenopausal women as well as in ApoE-/- mice, are associated with reduced expression of the estrogen receptor (ERα). Also, estradiol (E2) treatment in ApoE-/- mice further downregulated ERα expression, but the authors have not sufficiently demonstrated that this occurs in an iron-dependent manner, as the authors have concluded in section 3.3. The data showed that high iron and E2 treatment trigger the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway to degrade ERα via Mdm2-mediated degradation. Interestingly, iron chelation therapy restored ERα expression and attenuated E2-triggered atherosclerosis in late postmenopausal mice. Overall, the authors have concluded that in late postmenopause, iron accumulation prevents the HRT benefit through negative regulation of ERα expression via Mdm2-mediated proteolysis. However, important control groups in the in vivo experiments need to be included to support the conclusions made by the authors and variability in the in vitro experiments diminishes enthusiasm for the findings. Furthermore, in the in vitro experiments, the predominant reduction in ERalpha expression appears to be driven by iron even in the absence of E2, thus making it uncertain how specific these findings are to menopause.</p>
