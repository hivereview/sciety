    In this paper, Wujie Zhang and Michael Yartsev investigate some of the basic underpinnings of inter-brain synchrony in socially interacting animals. The phenomena of inter brain synchrony is fascinating and has been observed in a variety of situations across different mammalian species. It has also been proposed to play a critical role in certain social behaviors. Here, the authors report that brain activity across two interacting bats display not only similarities but also important differences. The also use advance computational modeling to capture s these two characteristics as well as to demonstrate how they are affected by the presence and absence of interaction between animal pairs.
