<p><strong>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>This is an extremely exciting and important study that constitutes a major (and long-awaited) advance in the molecular understanding of resurgent Na current. Reproducing resurgent current by expression of two proteins has never been done before: All studies that have tried to work their way toward the molecular mechanism have relied on peptides from candidate blocking proteins which mimic resurgent current, and co-expression of those candidate proteins with Na channels has been unsuccessful. Here, the authors have accomplished three things:</p>
<p>(1) They have for the first time successfully molecularly reconstituted Na channels that produce resurgent Na current by expressing the FHF4A protein with NaV1.8 or 1.9.<br>
(2) They have also reconstituted resurgent currents by coexpressing FHF2A with NaV1.5 or 1.7.<br>
(3) They have identified a key residue that regulates the sensitivity of NaV alpha subunits to resurgent-current mimicking open-channel block by the NaVbeta4 peptide.</p>
<p>Not only do these experiments satisfactorily and convincingly address a long-standing question (and give an idea of the wealth of molecular combinations that may generate resurgent current), they also open the door to molecular manipulation of this current, which will be highly informative and potentially of significant practical use, given the proposed role of the current in several disorders and disease states, including pain (as shown by these authors). The work is convincingly done and clearly presented.</p>
