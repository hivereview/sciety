    The activity in the frontal cortex of mammals has been previously shown to become more correlated in socially interacting animals than when they are alone. In the current study, the authors examine the differences in brain activity that emerge during social interactions. The correlations and differences in activity were shown to occur over different time scales, with mean correlations occurring over longer time scales whereas differences occur over shorter time scales. The authors made a model of these processes that show how feedback may give rise to these phenomena.
