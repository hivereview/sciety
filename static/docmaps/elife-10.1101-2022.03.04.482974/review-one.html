<p>This is an excellent paper with extensive data and important results. The authors present convincing data that resurgent sodium current from Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels is mediated, at least in part, by FHF proteins. They show that expression of FHF4A, and to a lesser extent, FHF1A, FHF2A, and FHF3A, can induce resurgent Na current in Nav1.8 channels expressed in ND7/23 cells and Nav1.9/beta1/beta2 channels expressed in HEK cells. They further show that shRNA knock-down of FHF4 can substantially reduce (though not eliminate) native Nav1.8-mediated resurgent current in DRG neurons, that this reduces repetitive firing of the neurons, and that repetitive firing can be restored by a peptide derived from the N-terminal of FHF4A. An additional very interesting result is the identification of an inner-pore residue that differs between Nav1.9 and Nav1.5 and when mutated in Nav1.5 almost eliminates the ability of the Navβ4 peptide to produce resurgent current without affecting resurgent current induced by FHF2A, suggesting different intrapore binding sites for the Navβ4 peptide and FHFs. Altogether, the results in the paper make a major contribution to understanding the molecular events involved in generating resurgent current in Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels. The paper contains an impressive amount of data building on an equally impressive foundation of techniques developed in previous work and the results are clear and convincing.</p>
<p>There are some aspects of the presentation that could be improved.<br>

It seems debatable whether the expression of Nav1.8 in ND7/23 cells constitutes truly "heterologous" expression. After all, ND7/23 cells are an immortalized DRG cell line. At the least, the authors need to explain why ND7/23 cells were used for the Nav1.8 expression and to acknowledge that ND7/23 cells may express proteins in addition to the transfected Nav1.8 and FHF that could be important for the generation of resurgent current. Did they ever attempt to express Nav1.8 and FHF4A in HEK or CHO cells? There should also be a reference to the literature (I suppose Lee et al PLoS One, 14:e0221156y, 2019) showing that ND7/23 cells do not express endogenous Nav1.8 currents.</p>
