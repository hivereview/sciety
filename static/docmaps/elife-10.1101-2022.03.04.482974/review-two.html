<p>This is an excellent report describing a new functionality for FHF sodium channel-binding proteins. Certain combinations of FHF and sodium channel isoforms enable the generation of resurgent current. Specifically, TTX-resistant sodium channels (Nav1.8 and Nav1.9) in conjunction with A-type FHFs result in a resurgent current. The mechanism involves an open-channel block analogous to the way A-type FHFs induce long-term inactivation of TTX-sensitive sodium channels. The researchers also employ FHF4 knockdown to show that endogenous A-type FHF underlies resurgent current in DRG neurons and enhanced excitability.</p>
