<p><strong>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools for synthesizing empirical evidence to advance our knowledge in life science. In this rigorously conducted meta-analytic study, the authors analyzed the data from 119 experiments from 110 published articles (92 on brain functional experiments from 87 articles and 27 on brain structural experiments from 23 papers) and investigated the functional and structural abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia across languages. Convergent and divergent functional and structural changes as well as language-universal and language-specific brain alternations related to dyslexia are found. In general, the study has generated important results and the findings are interesting.</p>
<p>I have the following comment:</p>
<p>Dyslexia in alphabetic languages is generally related to phonological deficits, so there are many neuroimaging experiments using phonology-based tasks. In Chinese, the core deficits of dyslexia are unknown, and neuroimaging tasks devised in the literature are more diverse. Although the authors have done well in Table 1 to specify the experimental tasks in various languages, the meta-analysis did not take into account the task types. I believe that in this article, it is not necessary to conduct task-type based meta-analyses, but one sentence or two in the Discussion section to mention this possibility and the limitation is necessary.</p>
