<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>In the present study, Xiaohui Yan and colleagues attempt to summarize the existing evidence on neurofunctional and neuroanatomical impairments in dyslexia (aka specific reading disorder) in different languages in a meta-analytic manner. The research questions the authors asked are essential but remain largely open. The meta-analysis is a powerful approach to address these problems, and the findings are appealing. Both universal and language-specific neural manifestations in dyslexia are revealed. With this knowledge, the researchers can design experiments to reveal/examine more specific hypotheses, while the educators can refine diagnostic methods and intervention programs. This study has several strengths, including (1) the research questions are explicitly and precisely declared at the beginning; (2) an advanced meta-analytic method (AES-SDM) was used; (3) a series of complementary analyses are done, including a confirmation study with well-matched English and Chinese studies was conducted; (4) a comprehensive discussion is given. At the same time, as too many questions are asked, the analyses/results/interpretations became quite complicated and sometimes hard to follow. In addition, several factors need to be further taken into consideration in data analysis and result explanation. Finally, it should be noted that given meta-analysis is a way to summarize the previous findings, it is necessary to conduct further studies based on it to directly examine the hypotheses. All in all, the main claims are supported by the data, while additional analyses would provide further support.</p>
<p>I have three main concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The imbalanced numbers of studies in alphabetic and morpho-syllabic languages may bias the results of primary meta-analysis pooling all studies together. Specifically, since there are many more alphabetic studies in this field, the results will mainly reflect patterns in these languages. This can be seen, e.g., when comparing figures S1-S2 with figures S3-S6. In this case, the result cannot answer whether there are the same functional and structural impairments in dyslexia in alphabetic and morpho-syllabic languages (i.e., the "both" question). The same issue exists for the multi-modal analysis across languages.</p></li>
<li><p>Age range difference may significantly influence the results of the primary meta-analysis across languages. It is shown in p. 15, lines 297-298, "the mean age was 16.55 years for controls and 16.23 years for participants with DD." However, such adolescent age ranges are a result of pooling studies in children and adults together. Given that (1) it has been revealed in previous literatures that participant's age modulates the neural manifestation in dyslexia, (2) fewer adolescent studies exist in alphabetic languages, and (3) research on morpho-syllabic languages is almost with children, the findings of the primary analysis might be influenced by age-related effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Some statements are out of the scope of this study and can be misleading. For instance, in the abstract (p.2, lines 17-19), it says, "...it is still not totally understood where and why the structural and functional abnormalities are consistent/inconsistent across languages." However, while the "why" question is an important one, unfortunately, the current meta-analysis does not answer it.</p></li>
