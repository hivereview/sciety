<p><strong>Evaluation Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In this rigorously conducted meta-analytic study, the authors investigated the functional and structural abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia across languages. Convergent and divergent functional and structural changes as well as language-universal and language-specific brain alternations related to dyslexia are found. In general, the study has generated important results and the findings are of interest to readers in educational psychology/neuroscience fields, especially those focusing on reading development and dyslexia. The analytic approach used in this study is cutting-edge, the data support the main claims, and a detailed discussion is presented.</p>
