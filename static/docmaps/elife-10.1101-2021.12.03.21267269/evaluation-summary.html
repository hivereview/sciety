<p><strong>Evaluation Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This study provides computational predictions on optimal combinations of broadly neutralizing antibodies for treating HIV-1, based on the finding that population diversity alone permits the prediction of the timing of viral escape from broadly neutralizing antibodies. The idea behind the approach used is good, although the analyses and computational data/results highlight important limitations of the modeling approach. Nonetheless, the study should be of broad interest to those studying viral responses to therapeutic interventions as well as to both evolutionary and computational biologists.</p>
