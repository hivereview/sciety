<p><strong>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>The authors attempted to identify an optimal combination of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that can suppress escape of HIV-1 from the therapy. To do so, the authors fit a birth-death model of viral dynamics using published longitudinal HIV sequence data from 9 untreated patients. Using inferred quantities to parametrize the model subject to bNAb infusion, they predict the distribution of rebound times of HIV in therapy trials with two mono-therapy and their combination. Finally, using deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to identify escape-mediating variants against 9 bnAbs for HIV, they propose a triplet combination that may best suppress early viral rebound.</p>
<p>While the goal is clear, there are a number of major weaknesses that curtail the quality of the work:</p>
<p>First, the approach is not novel. It at best represents a synthesis of known methods and published data sets.</p>
<p>Second, the analyses and computational data cannot justify the major claims, in particular the prediction on optimal bnAb combinations - the central goal of this work. Specifically, match of rebound time distribution is only achieved for early rebound due to ineffective bNAbs. This limited validity under restrictive assumptions (within a limited time window) thus cannot validate the optimality of identified combinations that count on effective bNAbs for delayed rebound. More importantly, the proposed optimal combinations are highly sensitive to data quality and depth. In particular, DMS data cannot faithfully probe low-frequency variants that are chiefly responsible for rebound, which undermines the predictive power of the approach.</p>
<p>Third, the main results are already known from earlier work. It has been long known that a combination of more than two bnAbs is more effective in suppressing early rebound than fewer. Moreover, it has been shown recently that bnAb (VRC01) infusion acts to amplify pre-existing bnAb-resistant viral strains, leading to fast HIV rebound. Hence, it is unclear what new insight this work confers.</p>
<p>Lastly, suppression of early rebound alone is not a sufficient measure of therapy efficacy. Late rebound is not necessarily a sign of viral control, but might instead indicate selection for cross-resistant viral mutants - an even more detrimental outcome. In addition, this work has neglected bnAb dynamics or influence of infused bnAbs on the response of endogenous B cells, which will be essential for understanding viral dynamics, especially when infused bnAbs are relatively effective at suppressing early rebound.</p>
