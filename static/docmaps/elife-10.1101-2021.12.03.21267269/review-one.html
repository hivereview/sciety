<p>This manuscript describes a robust computational approach for predicting the efficacy of strategies to passively administer bnAbs as a treatment for HIV. The results demonstrate an impressive ability to predict outcomes of treatment efficacy in past clinical trials, including the time for the virus to rebound after bnAb treatment. A key finding of this work, confirming an important finding from other recent studies, is that viral rebounds in bnAb efficacy trials are dominated by escape variants present in the patient prior to treatment, rather than escape variants arising spontaneously during therapy. The manuscript characterizes bnAbs as either "mutation-limiting" or "fitness-limiting" in terms of their effects on the evolving viral population, and provides testable hypotheses for how novel bnAb treatment strategies should be differentially designed based on differences in viral population dynamics across patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The presented mathematical framework is rigorously constructed such that meaningful insights can be gleaned into how bnAb therapies should be rationally designed to maximally suppress viral escape in HIV-infected individuals. Predictions are enabled by considering the role of neutral genetic diversity of the pre-treatment viral population, the number of potential viral escape trajectories from a given bnAb, and the fitness cost to the virus of making escape mutations. The model appears to be quite robust in terms of its ability to predict key outcomes of clinical trials, such as the time for the virus to rebound in HIV-infected patients following bnAb treatment. These results provide strong validity for the model and for the subsequent predictions of optimal treatment strategies.</p>
<p>The model represents an advance over past models of viral dynamics in patients following passive bnAb administration, which have been limited in their predictive power due to small sample sizes of participants in clinical trials. The current model overcomes this challenge through the use of high throughput viral genetic sequence data collected from treatment-native patients over the course of a decade. A statistical framework is employed to infer parameters from this data to parameterize the model, enabling accurate predictions against real clinical trial data of viral rebound times following bnAb treatment.</p>
<p>The presented mathematical framework could potentially be applied to the design of bnAb treatment strategies against a number of other evolving pathogens.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors do an admirable job of describing the limitations of the model, which include ignoring the effects of antibody concentration and IC50 neutralization during bnAb treatment, and the role of T-cell dynamics in infection. These limitations, among others mentioned by the authors, presumably play a role in the fact that the model does not actually reproduce features of viral population dynamics at short and long times.</p>
<p>Much work has been done in recent years to characterize the fitness landscape of HIV proteins, including the Env surface protein that contains the epitope targeted by the bnAbs studied in the current work. It is unclear if some of the early inference/parameterization steps carried out in the current study could have benefited from or been circumvented by making use of these fitness landscapes.</p>
<p>Lastly, more explanation should be provided to support the idea that HIV escape mutations from bnAbs should be intrinsically deleterious for the virus, beyond the fact that bnAbs typically bind to conserved sites. Since the footprint of a bnAb is often larger than the actual epitope - which may contain both variable and conserved sites (like the CD4 binding site studied herein) - bnAbs must bind to both residue types. If HIV escapes bnAbs via mutations at the variable sites surrounding the conserved residues, the fitness cost of these mutations would presumably be much lower or even minimal for the virus.</p>
