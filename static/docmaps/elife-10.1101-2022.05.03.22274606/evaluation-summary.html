<p><strong>Evaluation Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This paper is mainly for an audience of genetic epidemiologists interested in the evaluation and portability of polygenic scores. The authors show that a polygenic risk score to predict prostate cancer risk is very informative for individuals that are classified on three different ancestry categories. The authors show that the polygenic risk score can be used to predict the risk to develop prostate cancer as a function of age. This paper provides evidence that genetic information could be used to provide guidance to clinicians on when to perform screenings to detect prostate cancer in patients.</p>
