<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>Chen and Darst et al present a rigorous evaluation of a previously developed multi-ancestry polygenic risk score (PRS) for prostate cancer in multiple multi-ancestry datasets through meta-analysis. They found that their multi-ancestry PRS for prostate cancer shows strong risk stratification across European, African, and Hispanic populations (i.e., increased estimated associations with prostate cancer in increasing deciles of genetic risk). Consistent with previous literature, the authors showed that the PRS associations with prostate cancer risk attenuated in older men with higher genetic risks; the authors also show that this attenuation occurs in African ancestry men. Lastly, the authors show that men with higher genetic risk, across all three ancestry groups, reach a 5% absolute risk of prostate cancer far earlier than those in the median risk group. Overall, the results of the paper support the conclusions and the main take-home message of increasing sample sizes in non-European populations to fully evaluate the capabilities of this PRS in risk-stratifying during screening is clear.</p>
<p>The main strength of the study is a clear statement of aims and demonstration of conclusions. Applying this multi-ancestry PRS to multiple multi-ancestry datasets shows that the PRS is effective in risk stratification. The methods are well-articulated and the figures are easy to understand. I also commend the authors for providing links to data and sample code.</p>
<p>The main weakness is the lack of some background on polygenic scores. The manuscript is written for a genetic epidemiology and/or clinical audience, where a background understanding of polygenic scores is assumed. Adding context about PRS for a wider audience of life sciences readers would be warranted.</p>
