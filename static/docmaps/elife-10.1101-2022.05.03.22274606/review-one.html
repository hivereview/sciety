<p>This manuscript presents a useful application of a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score to predict the risk of prostate cancer in approximately 500,000 individuals that are classified on three different ancestry categories. The authors show that the multi-ancestry polygenic risk score can be used to predict the risk of prostate cancer in individuals of different ages that were classified to have either European, African, or Hispanic ancestry. The authors show that the ages of individuals must be taken into account, along with the polygenic risk score, to predict the risk of having prostate cancer.</p>
<p>This paper is very well conceived and the authors do a great job showing that the multi-ancestry polygenic risk score, previously developed by the same group, is a useful predictor of the risk to develop prostate cancer. The cohorts analyzed are very large and support the main conclusion made by the authors that the polygenic score is a useful tool to diagnose the risk for prostate cancer. The authors make a good case showing that taking into account the ancestral background of an individual along with the age and the polygenic score can be very useful in the clinic to make decisions about the frequency to perform prostate-specific antigen screenings on different patients.</p>
