<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>This paper reports a sub-study of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine Phase 3 trial, which aimed to identify groups of genes (blood transcriptional modules, BTMs) for which expression in DMSO or antigen-stimulated PBMCs was associated with clinical malaria during a 12-month follow-up period. Study subjects were infants and children who received either RTS,S/AS01 or comparator vaccines (meningococcal C for infants, rabies vaccine for children), enrolled in the study in Tanzania and Mozambique (with some additional analyses using samples from Gabonese infants).</p>
<p>Using PBMCs collected at baseline before vaccination and 3 months later (a month after the third vaccine dose), stimulated with DMSO or parasite antigens, the authors used RNA-sequencing to identify BTMs which were different between recipients of RTS,S/AS01 vs comparator vaccines; which were different between baseline and month 3 in RTS,S/AS01 recipients; and which differed between RTS,S/AS01 recipients with a malaria episode and those without a malaria episode during the follow-up period. This combination of analyses might help to distinguish BTMs specifically associated with RTS,S/AS01 vaccine efficacy from those associated with other factors influencing susceptibility to malaria. To further aid mechanistic understanding the authors examined correlations between BTMs and measures of cellular and humoral immune responses. To try to establish generalisability the authors examined whether BTMs identified in African children were also associated with developing malaria in RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated malaria-na√Øve adults in the United States who underwent controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).</p>
<p>Strengths of the study include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The relatively large number of subjects, the large amount of transcriptomic and immunological data which has been generated (and made publicly accessible), and the extensive analysis to evaluate associations between BTMs and numerous immunological variables.</li>
<li>Clear explanation of both the rationale and methods for most of the analyses</li>
<li>The attempt to validate findings in the CHMI studies</li>
<li>Matching of subjects to try to eliminate the confounding effects of age, study site, and time of vaccination</li>
</ol>
<p>Weaknesses of the study include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite the relatively large size of the study, it is hard to know whether it had sufficient power to achieve its main objective, and we are not presented with data to demonstrate how successfully the authors managed to match subjects for age, timing of vaccination and follow-up duration</li>
<li>The comparator group to the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is not a single vaccine, but two vaccines, but the presentation of the data makes it difficult to identify what effect this may have had on the results</li>
<li>A very "liberal" false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold has been used throughout to define significant associations. An FDR of 0.2 indicates that 20% (or 1 in 5) results which are considered significant will be false-discoveries. This means that the "significant" results must be interpreted with a high degree of caution. Typically researchers use lower FDR thresholds, like 0.05 or 0.01, although one may argue for different thresholds under different circumstances</li>
<li>A perplexing finding, which is not addressed in detail, is the large number of BTMs which differ between RTS,S and comparator vaccine groups after DMSO stimulation of PBMCs, but these are not seen when PBMCs are stimulated with parasite antigens in DMSO (and a similar finding for month 3 vs month 0 samples from RTS,S recipients). This raises some concern about the stimulation experiments, because one might expect that the DMSO vehicle in the antigen preparations would trigger a similar response to DMSO alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors partly achieved their aims. They identified BTMs differentially expressed between RTS,S/AS01 and the comparator vaccines, and between baseline and month 3 in RTS,S/AS01 recipients. They also identified BTMs at month 3 associated with developing malaria, and BTMs at baseline associated with developing malaria. These latter BTMs were partly replicated in the CHMI study subjects. Higher expression of BTMs associated with monocytes and dendritic cells were most consistently identified across the different analyses and their expression in stimulated baseline samples was most consistently associated with development of clinical malaria in RTS,S/AS01 recipients. However there were inconsistencies in associations between some of the studies, and it is possible that the "consistent" monocyte and dendritic cell BTMs would not be so consistent if a more stringent FDR threshold was used. However the authors conclusions are largely quite measured and for the most part they do not over-interpret the significance of their findings.</p>
<p>Overall the work provides some evidence that baseline immunological status, particularly related to monocyte and dendritic cell responses and possibly their role in or response to baseline inflammation, may be a determinant of how well the RTS,S vaccine works to prevent malaria. This provides a basis for further work to optimise the effectiveness of the vaccine. The usefulness of PBMC stimulation to predict an individual's response to vaccination will be limited because this is not a method which can be used at scale in resource limited settings, but the concept that vaccine response could be enhanced by modifying pre-vaccine immunological or inflammatory status is potentially important. The data published with this study will be a valuable resource and will undoubtedly be used by others to address similar questions. Increasing the efficacy of malaria vaccines remains an extremely important goal, and identifying possible mechanisms which restrict the efficacy of RTS,S is important.</p>
