<p><strong>Evaluation Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This paper assesses whether transcriptional signatures in antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells can predict protection from clinical malaria after vaccination with RTS,S AS01 in African children. It adds to the large body of literature looking for immune correlates of protection following RTS,S vaccination and will be of interest to the malaria vaccine community and to those studying in systems vaccinology. An association of malaria risk with monocytes before vaccination may have been uncovered, which will require thorough testing in future functional and mechanistic studies.</p>
