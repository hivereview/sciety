<p>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this paper. The full connectome of the Drosophila central complex is both the beginning and the end of an era. It provides the first comprehensive dataset of arguably the most enigmatic brain region in the insect brain. This endeavor has generated ground truth data for years of functional work on the neural circuits the connectome outlines, and constitutes an unparalleled foundation for exploring the structure function relations in nervous systems in general. This will be of great importance far beyond work on the Drosophila brain, and will have far reaching implications for comparative research on insect brains and likely also smoothen the path toward understanding navigation circuits in vertebrate nervous systems. Based on presented data, the paper develops overarching ideas (at exquisite detail) of how sensory information is transformed into head direction signals, how these signals are used to enable goal direction behavior, how goals are represented, and how internal state can modulate these processes. The connectome enables the authors to base these ideas and their detailed models on actual biological data, where earlier work was forced to indirectly infer or speculate. While significantly going beyond models of central-complex function that existed previously, the authors have to be much credited for incorporating huge amounts of existing knowledge and data into their interpretations, not only work from Drosophila, but also from many other insects. This makes this paper not only an invaluable resource on the connectome of the Drosophila central complex, but also a most comprehensive review on the current state of the art in central-complex research. This unifying approach of the paper clearly marks a reset of central-complex research, essentially providing a starting point of hundreds of new lines of enquiry, probably for decades to come.</p>
<p>Given the type and amount of data presented, the paper is clearly overwhelming. That said, it also clearly needs to be presented in the way it was done, mostly because no single aspect of the function of this neuropil makes as much sense in isolation as it makes sense when viewed in conjunction of all its other functions. The complexity of the neural circuits discussed is clearly reflected in the enormous scope of the paper. Nevertheless, the authors have done a fantastic job in breaking the circuits and their function down into digestible bits. The manuscript is very systematic in its approach and starts with sensory pathways leading to the CX, covering the clearly delineated head direction circuits and then moving on to the more complex and less understood parts, always maintaining a clear link between structure and function. As function is necessarily based on previous work, including that from other species, the results part is interwoven with interpretation, but this is clearly necessary to keep the text readable. The authors have made considerable efforts to provide additional introductions and summaries whenever needed, almost creating nested papers embedded within the overall paper.</p>
<p>The figures are equally overwhelming as the text at first sight, but when taking the time to digest each one in detail, they present the data in a rich and clear manner. The figures are often encyclopedic and will serve as reference about the central complex for years. The summary graphs that are presented in regular intervals are welcome resting places for the reader, helping to digest all the detailed information that has preceded or that will follow.</p>
<p>The analysis performed in the paper is excellent, comprehensive and should set the standard for any future work on this topic. Also, the text is very honest about the limits of the conclusions that can be reached based on this kind of data, which is important in generating realistic and feasible hypotheses for future experiments.</p>
