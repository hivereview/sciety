<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>In this incredibly detailed effort, Hulse, Haberkern, Franconville, Turner-Evans, and coauthors painstakingly and patiently reveal the connectivity of central complex neurons within one "hemibrain" EM-imaged connectome of a fruit fly. This is best read as one of a series of such detailed papers including Scheffer et al., 2020 (which introduces the dataset) and Li et al., 2020 (which focuses on the mushroom body).</p>
<p>The authors achieve two major goals. First, they present a full account of all neurons (by type) present in the central complex and the connections between them (including to and from regions outside the central complex). By necessity, this work only examines such connections within a single animal from whose brain the hemibrain volume was imaged. Nonetheless, the relatively conserved morphology of fly neurons (at the scale of which regions they form arbors within) allows the authors to confidently relate their neurons to known examples from genetically labeled lines imaged at the light level. (And in some cases, they are able to show that some neurons with similar morphology can then be further subdivided into different types on the basis of their connectivity). Importantly, the hemibrain dataset contains both sides of the central complex, allowing for a complete analysis.</p>
<p>Secondly, the authors contextualize the observed connectivity patterns within the known functions of the central complex (particularly navigation and sleep/arousal). Appropriately and importantly, they offer detailed explanations for how the circuitry observed can support these functions. In some cases, particularly in their discussion of the fan body, they show how the connectivity patterns can support multiple variations of models of path integration (and more broadly how its architecture supports vector computation in general). These analyses make their central complex connectome a useful map - there is little doubt that it will inspire many future experiments in the fly community.</p>
<p>The only limitations of this work are rooted in the nature of the source material: it's only one animal's brain and because it's EM-based there's often no way to know whether a given cell type (if new) is even excitatory or inhibitory (though, notably, the authors take care to note where this is the case and to offer alternate interpretations of the circuit function). Synaptic strength is another relative unknown (not to mention plasticity rules or modulatory influences). For EM-based connectomes, the number of synapses made between two neurons is considered the basis for determining whether or not they are meaningfully connected. However, this precise number can vary as a function of how complete the reconstructions are (generally, as proofreading progresses, more synapses are found). This work improves on prior hemibrain studies by carefully demonstrating that it is possible to set a threshold on the relative fraction of synaptic contributions within a region in order to identify meaningful connections. (That is, they find that as the number of synapses discovered increases, the relative contribution remains relatively constant).</p>
<p>This is a massive work. There are 75 figures, not including supplements, and numerous region and neuron names to keep track of (not to mention visualize). It is impossible to read in a single sitting. So for the purposes of this public review, I highly recommend to any reader that they first find the region of the paper they're interested in and skip to that to view in side-by-side mode. The "generally interested" reader is best served by reading through the Discussion, which has more of the structure-function analyses in it and then referring to the Results as their curiosity warrants.</p>
