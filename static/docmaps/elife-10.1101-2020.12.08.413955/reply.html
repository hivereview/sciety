<p><strong>Author Response:</strong></p>
<p>We are glad that the reviewers found the manuscript comprehensive and that they think it will likely be a useful resource for the community. We have made several changes with that in mind, incorporating input from a number of fly CX researchers. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have performed new analyses to improve our descriptions and characterization of phase angles in the PB and FB. Some of these changes, which have to do with the assignment of phase angles within the PB and FB columns, should help prevent any confusion or inconsistency relative to recent papers from the Maimon and Wilson labs.</li>
<li>Streamlined the Results section focused on dFB and EB sleep-wake circuits to aid in clarity.</li>
<li>Restructured and expanded the Discussion sections framing the CX as a multifunctional network to better capture previous physiological observations.</li>
<li>Added over 20 videos showing morphological renderings in 3D to help explain key results.</li>
<li>Analyzed the total number of synapses per region for the PB columnar neurons as a function of the number of neurons in each glomerulus (New Figure 24 S1).</li>
<li>Characterized the number of type-to-type connections between FB columnar neurons as a function of the percentage of total possible neurons that are actually connected (New Figure 33—figure supplement 1B).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>[...] This makes this paper not only an invaluable resource on the connectome of the Drosophila central complex, but also a most comprehensive review on the current state of the art in central-complex research. This unifying approach of the paper clearly marks a reset of central-complex research, essentially providing a starting point of hundreds of new lines of enquiry, probably for decades to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their generous comments. We are excited by the prospect of this manuscript being helpful for projects from many labs working in different insects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] The figures are equally overwhelming as the text at
first sight, but when taking the time to digest each one in detail, they present the data in a rich and clear manner. The figures are often encyclopedic and will serve as reference about the central complex for years. The summary graphs that are presented in regular intervals are welcome resting places for the reader, helping to digest all the detailed information that has preceded or that will follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We realize that the length and complexity of the manuscript makes it difficult to get through and to process. We are glad that the reviewer found the paper’s organization helpful in that regard. Although we have made many additions and edited the text and figures, we have tried to preserve the original organization and the mini-summaries with each section that the reviewer found useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The analysis performed in the paper is excellent, comprehensive and should set the standard for any future work on this topic. Also, the text is very honest about the limits of the conclusions that can be reached based on this kind of data, which is important in generating realistic and feasible hypotheses for future experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments on the analysis. We are making all the analysis code available open source, and have tried to package it in a way that we hope will make it easy for others to use and build upon.</p>

<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>[...] This is a massive work. There are 75 figures, not including supplements, and numerous region and neuron names to keep track of (not to mention visualize). It is impossible to read in a single sitting. So for the purposes of this public review, I highly recommend to any reader that they first find the region of the paper they're interested in and skip to that to view in side-by-side mode. The "generally interested" reader is best served by reading through the Discussion, which has more of the structure-function analyses in it and then referring to the Results as their curiosity warrants.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p>
