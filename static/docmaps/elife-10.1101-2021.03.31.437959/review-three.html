<p><strong>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</strong></p>
<p>In this paper, the authors ask whether selective sweeps (as measured by the iHS and nSL statistics) are more or less likely to occur in or near genes associated with Mendelian diseases ("disease genes") than those that are not ("non-disease genes"). The main result put forward by the authors is that genes associated with Mendelian diseases are depleted for sweep signatures, as measured by the iHS and nSL statistics, relative to those which are not.</p>
<p>The evidence for this comes from an empirical randomization scheme to assess whether genes with signatures of a selective sweep are more likely to be Mendelian disease genes that not. The analysis relies on a somewhat complicated sliding threshold scheme that effectively acts to incorporate evidence from both genes with very large iHS/nSL values, as well as those with weaker signals, while upweighting the signal from those genes with the strongest iHS/nSL values. Although I think the anlaysis could be presented more clearly, it does seem like a better analysis than a simple outlier test, if for no other reason than that the sliding threshold scheme can be seen as a way of averaging over uncertainty in where one should set the threshold in an outlier test (along with some further averaging across the two different sweeps statistics, and the size of the window around disease associated genes that the sweep statistics are averaged over). That said, the particular approach to doing so is somewhat arbitrary, but it's not clear that there's a good way to avoid that.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting that extreme values of iHS/nSL are generally less likely at Mendelian disease genes, the authors also report that this depletion is strongest in genes from low recombination regions, or which have &gt;5 specific variants associated with disease.</p>
<p>Drawing on this result, the authors read this evidence to imply that sweeps are generally impeded or slowed in the vicinity of genes associated with Mendelian diseases due to linkage to recessive deleterious variants, which hitchhike to high enough frequencies that the selection against homozygotes becomes an important form of interference. This phenomenon was theoretically characterized by Assaf et al 2015, who the authors point to for support. That such a phenomenon may be acting systematically to shape the process of adaptation is an interesting suggestions. It's a bit unclear to me why the authors specifically invoke recessive deleterious mutations as an explanation though. Presumably any form of interference could create the patterns they observe? This part of the paper is, as the authors acknowledge, speculative at this point.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit concerned by the fact that the signal is only present in the African samples studied. The authors suggest that this is simply due to stronger drift in the history of European and Asian samples. This could be, but as a reader it's a bit frustrating to have to take this on faith.</p>
<p>There are other analyses that I don't find terribly convincing. For example, one of the anlayses shows that iHS signals are no less depleted at genes associated with &gt;5 diseases than with 1 does little to convince me of anything. It's not particularly clear that # of associated disease for a given gene should predict the degree of pleiotropy experienced by a variant emerging in that gene with some kind of adaptive function. Failure to find any association here might just mean that this is not a particularly good measure of the relevant pleiotropy.</p>
<p>A last parting thought is that it's not clear to me that the authors have excluded the hypothesis that adaptive variants simply arise less often near genes associated with disease. The fact that the signal is strongest in regions of low recombination is meant to be evidence in favor of selective interference as the explanation, but it is also the regime in which sweeps should be easiest to detect, so it may be just that the analysis is best powered to detect a difference in sweep initiation, independent of possible interference dynamics, in that regime.</p>
