## Mission

Sciety’s mission is to grow a network of researchers who evaluate, curate and consume scientific content in the open. In doing so, we will support several long-term changes to scientific communication:

- Change peer review to better recognize its scholarly contribution
- Shift the publishing decision from editors to authors
- Move evaluation and curation activity from before to after publication

Our community-driven technology effort is producing an application that can support the changes in behaviour required to secure this future.

## Approach

We use techniques popularised by extreme programming to concentrate on meeting your needs and getting feedback early.

## Future direction and considerations

We gather feedback from users as we build which helps inform our future direction. Our [team Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ksVfD4E=/) is publicly available and shows our current work in progress as well as the longer term roadmap.
