## Summary

GigaScience aims to revolutionize publishing by promoting reproducibility of analyses and data dissemination, organization, understanding, and use. As an open access and open-data journal, we publish ALL research objects (data, software tools and workflows) from 'big data' studies across the entire spectrum of life and biomedical sciences. These resources are managed using the FAIR Principles for scientific data management and stewardship that state that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.
