## Our evaluation model

Life Science Editors provides an editorial assessment of a preprint. We hope to engage the scientific community in discussion, and provide an opportunity for the authors to refine and respond. Our assessment includes: the name of the reviewer, potential conflicts of interest and, in our view, the background of the study, the main question, the advance and the significance.

## PReF

The Preprint Review Features [(PReF)](https://osf.io/8zj9w/) describes key elements of each groupâ€™s evaluation activities.
