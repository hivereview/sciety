## Who we are
We are a group of scientists who are passionate about communicating science to fellow scientists and the public. We believe that scientific passion and progress rely on kindness, curiosity, trust and integrity. Our team brings diverse expertise from research, publishing, career development and grant writing. Life Science Editors provides a variety of services to help scientists obtain publications, funding and jobs, including editing, strategic advice, coaching, illustrations and workshops.

## Our evaluation model

Life Science Editors provides an editorial assessment of a preprint. We hope to engage the scientific community in discussion, and provide an opportunity for the authors to refine and respond. Our assessment includes: the name of the reviewer, potential conflicts of interest and, in our view, the background of the study, the main question, the advance and the significance.
