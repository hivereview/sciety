## Summary

Preprint Highlights are prepared by MBoCâ€˜s Early-Career Editors.

## Evaluation model

MBoC Preprint Highlights are prepared by our Early-Career Editors. These editors are responsible for selecting a preprint to highlight, writing the Significance Statement and assigning Badges. Authors do not submit their preprints to the journal for consideration as a Preprint Highlight. Preprint Highlights are not intended to constitute peer review of a preprint, and selection as a Preprint Highlight does not imply the preprint will be reviewed or published in MBoC or any other journal. We currently feature only preprints hosted on bioRxiv.

## People

In 2021 Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC) introduced a group of Early-Career Editors dedicated to curating and highlighting preprints. This group of postdocs and pre-tenure faculty write highlights and apply badges to preprints they select. Early-Career Editors will serve for a term of one to two years, with new members appointed each year. They will also receive training and mentorship from senior MBoC editors to support their growth as future leaders in their research communities.
