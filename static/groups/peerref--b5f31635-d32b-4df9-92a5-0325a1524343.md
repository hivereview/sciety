## Summary

PeerRef organizes journal-independent open peer review for all research. 

We are building a simple, fast, and cost-effective peer review service to meet the needs of researchers. We aim to put an end to the time-consuming, uncertain, complex, and expensive process of journal publication. 

Our vision is that Journal publication will become less essential as researchers post Preprints on reputable servers, then seek open peer review afterwards.  

By offering open journal-independent peer review, we aim to: 

- Verify pre-prints and put an end to expensive, delayed publications

- Increase the prevalence of peer reviewed negative results and replication studies 

- Provide feedback for for researchers at any stage: grant proposals, registered reports, iterative studies, etc. 

- Stop resubmission and review at multiple journals

- Increase trust in peer reviewers, not journal titles 

- Put an end to journal-specific formatting 

- Reduce the cost of open research

## Evaluation model

Authors post a Preprint, then request peer review from PeerRef. PeerRef identifies suitable referees and requests that they review the Preprint. Referees complete a structured peer review form and indicate their initial decision on the manuscript. Authors can address any revisions and respond to the referees. Referees then make a final decision on the manuscript.
