## Summary

Our vision is for all researchers to access a single point of peer review. Enabling all research to be trusted and accelerated.

PeerRef is a journal-independent open peer review platform. It organises peer review of preprints and publishes peer review reports. This approach can accelerate research by creating a single point of peer review in the publication process. The platform also aims to expand research. It does this by reducing the barriers to accessing peer review and asks referees to focus on academic rigour, rather than perceived impact.

Referees are responsible for making the decisions on manuscripts. The author has multiple options following peer review:

- Share the refereed manuscript with the community
- Submit the manuscript to a partner journal
- Submit the manuscript and consolidated review reports to a non-partner journal

## Evaluation model

Authors post a Preprint, then request peer review from PeerRef. PeerRef identifies suitable referees and requests that they review the Preprint. Referees complete a structured peer review form and indicate their initial decision on the manuscript. Authors can address any revisions and respond to the referees. Referees then make a final decision on the manuscript.

## PReF

Sciety uses the PReF (preprint review features) descriptors to describe key elements of each Group's evaluation activities, helping readers to interpret and compare their evaluations.
