## Summary

eLife reviews preprints in the life sciences and medicine, and is committed to improving peer review to better convey the assessments made by editors and reviewers. Our approach brings together the immediacy and openness of a preprint with the scrutiny of peer review by experts.

## Evaluation model

Our approach brings together the immediacy and openness of a preprint with the scrutiny of peer review by experts.

- We only review articles that have been made available as preprints.
- Editors who are active researchers decide which preprints are reviewed.
- Editors and reviewers discuss the reviews with each other.
- There is no accept/reject decision after peer review: rather, every article we review is published on the eLife website as a Reviewed Preprint that includes an eLife assessment, public reviews, and a response from the authors (if available).
- We do not artificially limit the number of articles we review or publish.
- At any point following peer review, authors can choose to have their Reviewed Preprint published as a regular journal article (known as the Version of Record) to mark the end of the publishing process.
