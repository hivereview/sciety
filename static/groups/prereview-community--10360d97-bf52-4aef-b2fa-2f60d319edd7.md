## Summary

PREreview's mission is to bring more diversity to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering community of researchers, particularly those at early stages of their career (ECRs) to review preprints.

We envision a system in which any researcher, regardless of their prior engagement with journal-organized peer review, career level, geographical location, institutional affiliation, research field, gender, sexual orientation, and ability is invited to share openly constructive feedback on early version of research manuscripts shared as preprints on any web server.

## Peer review model

At PREreview we believe all researchers should be allowed to help others by reviewing the work of their peers, as long as it is done constructively.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation in the form of peer review. PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level, to provide feedback to emerging scientific output.

At PREreview we ask all contributors to disclose any competing interest (CI) that may exist between a rapid review author (or affiliated organization) and the author(s) (or affiliated organization) of the reviewed preprint.
