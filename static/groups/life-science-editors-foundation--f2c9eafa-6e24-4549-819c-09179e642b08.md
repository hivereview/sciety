## Who we are

The scientific community, particularly at leadership levels, suffers from a lack of diversity. This disparity arises, in part, from unfair and systemic barriers to progress. Scientists who have been excluded from the community have fewer role models and smaller networks, which makes it more challenging to climb the career ladder. They often carry a greater burden inside and outside work. We want to change the scientific culture to make it more inclusive, equitable, and diverse. To achieve this goal, we offer [JEDI awards](https://lifescienceeditors.org/apply/) and we review preprints authored by scientists from underrepresented groups to highlight and support their contributions.

## Our evaluation model

The Life Science Editors Foundation comprises volunteers with expertise in publishing, career development and research. Our assessment includes: the name of the reviewer, potential conflicts of interest and, in our view, the background of the study, the main question, the advance and the significance.

## PReF

The Preprint Review Features [(PReF)](https://osf.io/8zj9w/) describes key elements of each group’s evaluation activities.
