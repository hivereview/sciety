## Summary
Peer Community in Neuroscience (PCI Neuro) is a community of neuroscientists  who peer-review and recommend unpublished preprints publicly available from open archives such as HAL, Zenodo, arXiv, OSF-preprints, and bioRxiv. The peer-review process of PCI Neuro is very similar to that of conventional journals, except that it is transparent; peer-reviews and editorial correspondence are published and open data and code are required. Preprints recommended by PCI Neuro are finalized, peer-reviewed articles that can be used and cited, like any other article published in a conventional journal. A refereed preprint by PCI Neuro is a reliable and high quality manuscript that does not need to be published in conventional journals, although further submission in a journal is possible.
